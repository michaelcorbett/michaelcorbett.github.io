                    <h2>I have 18+ years experience of building web applications/sites for clients across various business sectors. In the last 5-6 years I have focused more on large scale SAAS projects.</h2>
                    <p>Though I promote myself primarily as a front-end developer, I am comfortable integrating with backend technologies too. My current work environment is a LAMP setup with front-end tasks handled by Smarty, CSS and HTML.</p>
                    <p>I am a driven developer, I work well within a team or on individual tasks. I don't rest on laurels, I believe that my work and environment need to evolve with technology. To that end I like to keep learning, I am currently taking an online course on ReactJS. I am also learning Symphony 2, an enterprise level content manage system for web applications.</p>
                    <p>I'm an avid record collecting, technology obsessed, caffeine addicted husband and father.</p>
